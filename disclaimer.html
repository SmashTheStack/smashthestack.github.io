        <h1 style="color:#80a630">Publishing Terms and Conditions </h1><br/><hr>

        <br/><p>By submitting content to the smashthestack website you are deemed tohave accepted these terms and conditions:</p> <br/>

        <h2>1. Your Copyright </h2><br/>
        Any content submitted to the smashthestack site remains the intellectual property of the author or copyright holder (which means that you can re-publish your content or adaptations of your content elsewhere). However, by submitting content to the smashthestack website you grant permission for smashthestack to publish your content on the smashthestack website and to modify, adapt, edit, reproduce and create derivative works based on your content (for example, to publish an excerpt in smashthestack email newsletters), without payment to the author or copyright holder, in perpetuity. (See disclaimer below.) <br/><br/>

        <h2>2. Libel </h2><br/>
        To the maximum extent permitted at law, smashthestack holds the author or copyright holder responsible for any defamatory or libellous remarks made in the content they submit (see disclaimer below). Libel means to defame, or take away a good name. Libel can be proven even when the plaintiff is referred to indirectly. The tests of defamation include: hatred, ridicule or contempt; causing the subject to be shunned or avoided; 'lowering a person in the estimation of right-minded people'; and - most relevant here - implying a lack of qualification, knowledge, skill, capacity, judgement or efficiency to conduct business. Malicious falsehood means the publication of a false statement that damages a person. In criminal defamatory libel one publication could be the subject of both civil and criminal proceedings and the defamer could be made to pay damages.

        ii) is your own original work and that you have the right to make it available to smashthestack for publication on the smashthestack website and other purposes outlined above; and <br/><br/>

        iii) is not defamatory; and <br/><br/>
